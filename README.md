## Motivation
The goal of this project was to demonstrate my capabilites using Object-Relational Mapping. This example is a online store. My focus was the backend; using a Express.js API and manipulating a MYSQL database using Sequelize. There is seeded information to help produce the feel a e-commerce store.

## Problems
The problems I ran into while creating the routes for the api were really using the sequelize and apporiated naming the "req.parama.(which ever word I needed)" for exapmle testing it multiple ways in order to ifnd it out was the only thing I could do to figure it out. This problem was more so in the PUT and POST. THe GET' weren' nearly as annoying I'd like to say.

## What I Learend
Through trial and error is the way I Learned this time around. To be completely honest I'll probably make the same mistake again, but I am completely confindent that I'll be able to work through my problem and arrive at a solution. Creating a fully functioning code.

## Stand Out
What Makes this project stand out is that it highlights the use of Sequlize (now how i'm bout to say this is may be wrong but its how I understand it) to create a table in the db and joining the diffent tables such as the product and tags and the product to a category.
